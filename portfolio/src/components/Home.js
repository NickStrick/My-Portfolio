     Udemy, or Watch and Code. I spent these past two years enrolled in Lambda School as a student and as a contract teaching assistant.

     I was a contract worker for Lambda School as well, where I frist worked as a Team lead above students, leading daily meetings, solving any debugging issues, 
     helping my students learn the cirriculum in javscript, java, and python. The times I was working on a project with a team, I was responsible with the relationship between the stakeholder and the team,
      and managed our planning. I also debugged and filled any gaps in the conribution to the project where nessesary. I spent most of my time in meetings getting to know my students 
      and solving problems or planning with them and creating documentation.`;
